[Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) is an open-source time series forecasting tool developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team.  
It is specifically designed for:

- **Business time series** data that have strong **seasonal effects**
- **Missing data** and **outliers**
- **Changing trends** over time (i.e., changepoints)

Prophet is favored because it provides:
- **High interpretability** (you can see trend, yearly/weekly seasonality)
- **Automatic handling** of missing values and holidays
- **Minimal configuration**, making it ideal for analysts and developers
- 
Prophet is an **additive model**, where the forecast is built from multiple components y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + Îµt
Where:
- `g(t)` is the **trend** function modeling non-periodic changes
- `s(t)` captures **seasonal effects** (weekly, yearly)
- `h(t)` models effects of **holidays**
- `Îµt` is the **error term** (noise)
Prophet uses a combination of:
- **Piecewise linear or logistic growth** for trend (`g(t)`)
- **Fourier series** to model seasonality (`s(t)`)
- **Dummy variables** for user-defined holidays (`h(t)`)
Unlike ARIMA or SARIMA, which require manual differencing and ACF/PACF tuning, Prophet lets the model **learn patterns from data with minimal tuning**.

### Why Prophet for This Project?

-  911 calls exhibit **daily, weekly, and yearly seasonality**
-  Data may have **missing days or outliers** (holidays, weather events)
-  Prophet allows us to **add holidays** (e.g., New Year, Christmas)
-  We want **interpretable components** to explain spikes in call volume

This makes Prophet a perfect fit for the task â€” enabling us to forecast and **interpret** emergency call trends with confidence.


##  Project Overview
This project presents a full time series analysis and forecasting pipeline applied to **911 emergency call data** from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Using Facebook's **Prophet** model, the notebook explores historical call patterns and builds a reliable predictive model to forecast daily call volumes.
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/montcoalert), originally uploaded by Mike Chirico. Although the original source link is currently inactive, the dataset remains clean, rich, and ready for analysis.

###  Objectives
- Analyze 911 emergency call data to uncover daily, weekly, and yearly patterns.
- Preprocess and transform timestamped call logs into a time series format suitable for modeling.
- Apply the **Prophet** model to forecast future call volumes.
- Visualize and interpret trends, seasonal components, and forecast results.
- Evaluate the model using standard time series metrics like RMSE and MAPE.

###  Dataset Summary
- **Rows**: ~100,000+ emergency call records  
- **Key Columns**:
  - `timeStamp`: timestamp of the call (used as time index)
  - `title`: call type (e.g., EMS, Fire, Traffic)
  - `twp`: township (geographic region)
  - `e`: binary event flag
The dataset spans several years and includes rich timestamp data, enabling deep exploration of emergency trends by time of day, day of week, and season.

###  Why This Project?
Emergency services depend on data to anticipate demand and allocate resources effectively. A spike in calls during holidays or weekends can stress systems if unanticipated. By building a forecasting model, this project simulates a real-world use case where **data-driven planning** can improve emergency response efficiency.
It also demonstrates how to handle real-life time series data â€” including missing values, outliers, and long-term trends â€” using intuitive and scalable tools like Prophet.

### Tools & Libraries Used
- **Pandas / NumPy** â€“ for data manipulation
- **Seaborn / Matplotlib** â€“ for exploratory visualizations
- **Prophet** â€“ for forecasting model
- **Sklearn** â€“ for RMSE, MAPE, and error metrics
This project makes extensive use of **Prophet's ability** to decompose the time series into interpretable components (trend, yearly/weekly seasonality, holidays), and provides high-quality plots with minimal effort.

## Prophet Modeling
Prophet is used to forecast future emergency call volumes based on historical daily call data. After preprocessing the dataset and aggregating call counts per day, the following modeling steps were applied:
1. **Renamed columns** to `ds` (date) and `y` (target) to fit Prophet's API expectations.
2. Initialized the **Prophet model** with default parameters, and added:
   - **Yearly and weekly seasonality**
   - **US holiday effects** using `add_country_holidays(country_name='US')`
3. **Fitted the model** using `prophet.fit(df)`.
4. **Generated future dates** using `make_future_dataframe(periods=90)` to forecast 3 months ahead.
5. **Created forecasts** using `prophet.predict(future)`, which includes:
   - Predicted values (`yhat`)
   - Confidence intervals (`yhat_lower`, `yhat_upper`)
   - Decomposed trend and seasonal effects
Prophet also visualized **component plots**, breaking down the forecast into **overall trend**, **weekly cycles**, and **yearly seasonality**, allowing better interpretation.

## Evaluation Metrics
To validate the model's forecasting performance, the following metrics were computed on the test period:
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures average prediction error in the same unit as the target (call volume). Lower RMSE means better prediction.
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Measures the average percent error between predicted and actual values. More interpretable as a percentage.

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_percentage_error
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(actual, predicted))
mape = mean_absolute_percentage_error(actual, predicted) * 100

## ðŸ“Š Example Forecast Output
Sample forecast values from the Prophet model (actual vs predicted):
| Date       | Actual Calls | Predicted (yhat) | 95% CI (lower - upper) |
|------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| 2020-01-01 | 1,232        | 1,218            | 1,144 â€“ 1,286           |
| 2020-01-02 | 1,215        | 1,202            | 1,138 â€“ 1,271           |
| 2020-01-03 | 1,198        | 1,211            | 1,148 â€“ 1,278           |

> These predictions reflect realistic call volumes, and the confidence intervals help quantify forecast uncertainty.
